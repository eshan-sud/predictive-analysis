Objective: 
The aim of this project is to showcase your understanding of Exploratory Data Analysis 
(EDA) and predictive modeling. You will work with a dataset of your choice, analyze it 
thoroughly, and apply predictive analytics to uncover patterns and insights. 
Instructions: 

1. Dataset Selection: 
• Choose a dataset relevant to any area of interest (e.g., finance, healthcare, 
retail, social media). 
• The dataset should have sufficient data points (at least 200 rows) and a mix of 
numerical and categorical features. 

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset, including: 
• Summary statistics and data distributions. 
• Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates). 
• Feature engineering and transformation, if necessary. 
• Visualizations to reveal insights (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlations). 

3. Predictive Modeling: 
• Choose an appropriate predictive modeling technique (e.g., linear regression, 
decision trees, or any classification method if applicable). 
• Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20). 
• Train and evaluate your model, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, 
recall, or RMSE (for regression models). 
• Interpret and document your model’s performance. 

4. Report and Submission: 
• Compile your findings, EDA insights, and model evaluation in a report. 
• Submit the code used in a Jupyter Notebook or a similar format alongside 
your report.

1. Introduction 
Briefly introduce the objective of the assignment. State the significance of 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling. 
2. Dataset Overview - Dataset Source: Describe the source of the dataset (e.g., open-source, created, 
etc.). - Dataset Description: Outline key details like the number of rows, columns, and 
general types of features. - Objective: State what you aim to achieve by analyzing and modeling this data. 
3. Data Preparation - Data Cleaning: Describe any preprocessing steps taken (e.g., handling missing 
values, removing duplicates). - Feature Engineering: Mention any new features created or existing features 
transformed. - Summary Statistics: Provide a table with summary statistics (mean, median, 
mode, etc.) for each feature. 
4. Exploratory Data Analysis - Data Distributions: Include visualizations (histograms, bar charts) to show 
distributions. - Correlation Analysis: Present correlation tables or heatmaps for feature 
relationships. - Key Insights: Summarize observations and findings from EDA, such as trends, 
outliers, or patterns. 
5. Predictive Modeling - Model Selection: Explain the model chosen and why it fits the data. - Training and Testing: Describe the train-test split used (e.g., 80/20). - Model Training: Document model parameters and settings during training. - Model Evaluation: Provide evaluation metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, 
precision, recall, or others relevant to the model type. 
6. Results and Model Evaluation - Results Summary: Include key results, comparing model performance. - Interpretation: Explain the relevance of model outcomes and how they answer 
the project objective. - Visualization: Where applicable, provide charts or graphs showing model 
performance (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve). 
7. Conclusion and Future Work - Summary of Findings: Briefly summarize what the project accomplished. - Limitations: Note any limitations or challenges faced in modeling. - Future Improvements: Suggest improvements or additional analyses that could 
enhance the model.
