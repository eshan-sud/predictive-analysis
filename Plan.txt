Step 1: Dataset Selection

Choose Dataset: Download a dataset on air quality (e.g., Air Quality Data).
Check Requirements: Ensure the dataset has at least 200 rows and includes both numerical (e.g., PM2.5, temperature) and categorical features (e.g., city name).


Step 2: Data Preparation

Import Libraries: Load essential Python libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
Load Data: Import the dataset using pd.read_csv().
Check Data: Use df.info(), df.describe() to understand the structure and summary statistics.
Handle Missing Values:
	Use df.isnull().sum() to check for missing values.
	Fill missing values using techniques like mean/mode imputation or KNNImputer.
Remove Duplicates: Use df.drop_duplicates() to eliminate duplicate rows.
Feature Engineering:
	Date Features: Extract month, day, or hour if a timestamp column exists.
	New Features: Create new features (e.g., pollution index by normalizing pollutants).


Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary Statistics:
	Use df.describe() to understand data distributions (mean, median, std).
	Check for outliers using box plots (sns.boxplot()).
Data Distributions:
	Plot histograms for numerical features (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, CO levels).
	Use sns.histplot() or plt.hist() to understand frequency distributions.
Correlation Analysis:
	Create a correlation heatmap (sns.heatmap()) to check relationships between features.
	Identify highly correlated variables for potential multicollinearity issues.
Key Insights:
	Summarize findings, such as trends in pollution over time or correlation with weather conditions.


Step 4: Predictive Modeling
Define Target Variable:
	Choose a target variable (e.g., PM2.5 concentration).
Split Data:
	Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split() (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Select Model:
	Choose a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor).
	Explain why the chosen model is appropriate (e.g., Linear Regression for simple relationships, Random Forest for complex relationships).
Train Model:
	Train your model using model.fit(X_train, y_train).
Model Evaluation:
	Evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score (metrics.mean_squared_error(), metrics.r2_score()).
	Print results and interpret model performance.


Step 5: Results and Model Evaluation

Results Summary:
	Document evaluation metrics for each model tested.
	Compare model performances (e.g., RMSE of Decision Tree vs. Random Forest).
Visualize Performance:
	Plot actual vs. predicted values using scatter plots (plt.scatter()).
	If using classification (e.g., predicting air quality category), create a confusion matrix (plot_confusion_matrix()).
Interpret Results:
	Analyze why certain models performed better.
	Discuss any overfitting or underfitting issues based on evaluation metrics.


Step 6: Conclusion and Future Work

Summary:
	Summarize what you achieved, such as predicting air quality with reasonable accuracy.
Limitations:
	Note any limitations, such as a lack of recent data, missing features (e.g., real-time traffic), or multicollinearity.
Future Improvements:
	Suggest future enhancements, like using more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost) or incorporating additional data (e.g., weather forecasts).


Step 7: Report Compilation

Create Report:
	Follow the template to compile your analysis into a report (Introduction, Dataset Overview, etc.).
Code Submission:
	Organize your code in a Jupyter Notebook, clearly commenting on each step.
	Ensure reproducibility by using consistent random seeds in model training (random_state).


Tools to Use:

Jupyter Notebook: For analysis and visualization.
Python Libraries:
	EDA: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn.
	Modeling: scikit-learn for regression models, xgboost for advanced techniques (optional).
